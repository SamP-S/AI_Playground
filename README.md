# AI Playground

## Goals

### Playground
[ ] - Implement generic ai fine tuning program
[ ] - Support pausing and continuing training when needed
[ ] - CLI only

### Training
[ ] - Fine tuning should involve transfer learning
[ ] - Hyperparameter selection will likely be required
[ ] - Support nvidia GPU parallelisation

### Models
[ ] - Resnet18 (2015)
[ ] - Resnet50/Resnet152 (2015)
[ ] - MobileNetv3 (2019)
[ ] - ViT (2021/2022)
[ ] - Dino ViT (2023)
[ ] - DeiT (2021/2023)

### Evaluation
[ ] - Models should be saved often for evaulation later, every epoch
[ ] - Loss & accuracy should be saved per batch to be able to recreate graphs
